# React + Vite

#VisitBook App
A project made with React + Vite and Leaflet to handle the map:
The project has a fake login with predefined login id and password for now, you can add locations you visited and some comment about them, date when you visited and store into a list , data is stored as JSON into data/cities.json file.

You can check out my project deployed at : https://visit-book-app.netlify.app/

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
